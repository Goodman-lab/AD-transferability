# AD-transferability
Code for the paper - Quantifying Applicability Domain transferability using Tanimoto similarity: A toxicological perspective

The Python 3 notebook for this project is available for download. The notebook contains the following code for:

 - Fingerprint generator
 - Modeller
 - For calculating similarities of specified targets vs all 79 targets
 - For calculating similarities of specified targets vs all 79 targets (with Multiprocessing)
 - For scrubbing datasets

To run code, select the required cell(s)/code blocks in the notebook and run them.

Fingerprint generator and Modeller code were taken from https://github.com/teha2/chemical_t-oxicology/tree/master/NeuralNetworks-March2020/Comparis-on%20Data
